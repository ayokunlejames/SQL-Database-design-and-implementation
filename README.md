# SQL-Database-design-and-implementation
In this project, I designed a database system for a humanitarian crisis response organization, modelling the database in Oracle SQL 
Modeller and implementing using PostgreSQL PgAdmin. I defined the scenario, defined the business rules, articulated information needs 
and conceptual model. I  created an appropriate Entity-Relationship (ER) model with properly defined entity relationships. I normalized
the database with every entity in Third Normal Form (3NF).

I then implemented the information system by creating the required entities, and defining integrity constraints for each entity. I also 
populated each entity with mock values and queried the tables to gather insights. I discussed data security, ethics, and integrity in
the context of my scenario.
